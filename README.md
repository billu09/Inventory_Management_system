Inventory Management System is a full-stack web application built using Spring Boot, React, and MySQL. The system supports two roles: Admin and Company. The Admin manages company registrations, controls login access, and can enable or disable company accounts. Each Company maintains its own profile and independently manages products, purchases, stock levels, and sales records. The application ensures role-based access control, secure data handling, and real-time inventory tracking for efficient business operations.
